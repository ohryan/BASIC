# write up for my comp sci class

## Intro
### Goals
- Make a basic interpreter
- Make it portable to my OS [BubblesOS](https://github.com/z3roco01/BubblesOS)
- Basic bult-ins such as PRINT GOTO FOR
- Support for 26 variables referenced by letters
- Basic math and bitwise operations
- Basic branching (if ... else)

## Conclusion
### Goals
I compleated all my goals, except making it portable. I would need to do something like make a header that contains all the OS depentant functions so I can change them to my OS's functions.</br>
The obstacles I encountered where quite a few memory errors as I have to manage my own memory and how to store each line of source code in a way it can be modified and found by number, I also didn't quite know how to make an interpreter so I had to learn.</br>
If given more time i would implement a better interpreter for the math allowing for larger equations and ones that can be used everywhere, I would also implement strings.</br>
I think my code is pretty efficent but could have small optimizations in most places.</br>
I learnt how to make an interpreter.
